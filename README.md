# Vigil

Vigil is the leading open source AI SOC: an agentic SOC with 13 specialized AI agents, 30+ MCP integrations, and 7,200+ community detection rules, released under Apache 2.0. Your playbooks are plain-text files, your agent logic is readable Python, and your integrations use an open standard ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)). Every proprietary AI SOC on the market is a black box you rent. Vigil is a capability you own.

Vigil pairs with [LogLM](https://www.deeptempo.ai/platform), a cybersecurity foundation model for [behavioral anomaly detection](https://www.deeptempo.ai/learning-center/behavioral-anomaly-detection), to form the [Intelligent Defense Platform](https://www.deeptempo.ai) from [DeepTempo](https://www.deeptempo.ai). Measured in the open by [SOCBench](https://socbench.org). Docs and community: [vigilsoc.org](https://vigilsoc.org).

The inspiration for the project is in part StackStorm and the experience of some of the founders of this project had in building the Linux Foundation project [StackStorm](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2) and in supporting Netflix and others who used StackStorm to achieve, carefully, very high levels of automation.  You'll sometimes hear us talking about the journey towards full autonomy and lessons learned.  One lesson - the system can only demote itself and only humans can promote additional autonomy.  You'll find this playing out on the way Vigil is designed; for example Vigil will check thresholds for projected costs and confidence levels in completion before executing an automation.  If it looks dodgy or too expensive, it'll double check with the humans before moving ahead.  

The project is built on three pillars: **Agents** — 13 specialized AI agents you can read, fork, and rewire; **Workflows** — multi-agent playbooks defined as Markdown files you edit directly; and **Integrations** — 30+ tool connections via MCP that you configure, not a vendor. The most important pillar is **YOU** — this is your project. Contribute via feedback, code, a repo star, memes on Discord, or otherwise.

## 12 Specialized AI Agents

Every agent has access to 19 backend tools via Agent SDK and 100+ additional tools via MCP. Agents are the building blocks that Workflows orchestrate.

| Agent | Role | Thinking | Key Capability |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Triage** | Rapid alert assessment | Fast | Severity scoring, false-positive filtering, escalation decisions |
| **Investigator** | Root cause analysis | Deep | Evidence collection, timeline reconstruction, cross-source correlation |
| **Threat Hunter** | Proactive hunting | Deep | Hypothesis-driven anomaly detection, pattern intelligence from 7,200+ rules |
| **Correlator** | Multi-signal linking | Deep | Campaign identification, attack chain reconstruction, entity mapping |
| **Responder** | Containment actions | Fast | NIST IR containment, blast radius assessment, confidence-scored approval requests |
| **Reporter** | Documentation | Balanced | Executive summaries, technical reports, audience-tailored content |
| **MITRE Analyst** | ATT&CK mapping | Deep | Technique identification, coverage analysis, gap prioritization, detection templates |
| **Forensics** | Digital forensics | Deep | Artifact analysis, chain of custody, multi-domain examination |
| **Threat Intel** | IOC enrichment | Deep | Actor attribution, campaign tracking, OSINT integration |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory checks | Balanced | NIST, ISO, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 assessment |
| **Malware Analyst** | Malware examination | Deep | Static/dynamic analysis, family classification, C2 identification |
| **Network Analyst** | Traffic analysis | Deep | Flow analysis, protocol anomalies, lateral movement detection |

## Workflows — One-Click Multi-Agent Workflows

Workflows are the operational core of Vigil. Each workflow chains multiple specialized AI agents into an end-to-end playbook that executes with a single command. No manual hand-offs, no copy-pasting between tools — the agents coordinate automatically.  

| Workflow | Agents | What It Does |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Incident Response** | Triage → Investigator → Responder → Reporter | NIST IR framework: triage an alert, investigate root cause, contain the threat, produce an audit-ready report |
| **Full Investigation** | Investigator → MITRE Analyst → Correlator → Responder → Reporter | Deep-dive with ATT&CK mapping, cross-signal correlation, response planning, and comprehensive documentation |
| **Threat Hunt** | Threat Hunter → Network Analyst → Malware Analyst → Threat Intel → Reporter | Hypothesis-driven hunting across network, endpoint, and threat intel — with IOC enrichment and detection recommendations |
| **Forensic Analysis** | Forensics → Malware Analyst → Network Analyst → Reporter | Post-incident digital forensics with evidence preservation, chain-of-custody documentation suitable for legal proceedings |

**How it works:** Say `"Run incident response on finding f-20260215-abc123"` and the system sequences four agents — triage scores the alert, investigator digs into root cause, responder submits containment actions with confidence-based approval, and reporter generates the final documentation.

Workflows are defined as `WORKFLOW.md` files in the `workflows/` directory and are fully customizable. Create your own by defining the agent sequence, tools used, and phase-by-phase instructions.

### Create Your Own Workflow in 60 Seconds

Every workflow is a Markdown file. Here's what one looks like inside:

```markdown
---
name: phishing-triage
description: "Triage and investigate phishing reports from user submissions."
use_case: "A user reports a suspicious email and the SOC needs to assess, investigate, and contain."
trigger_examples:
  - "Run phishing triage on finding f-20260401-abc123"
  - "Investigate this phishing report"
objectives:
  - "Decide whether the reported mail is malicious"
  - "Contain it without waiting on a second report"
phases:
  - id: assess
    agent: triage
    name: "Assess the Report"
    tools: [get_finding, list_findings]
    instructions: |
      Fetch the finding, extract sender/domain/URLs, score severity, check for
      known-bad indicators. Hand on the verdict and the indicators you found.

  - id: investigate
    agent: investigator
    name: "Investigate"
    tools: [get_finding, nearest_neighbors, search_detections]
    instructions: |
      Use nearest_neighbors to find similar reports. Correlate with detection
      rules. Build an evidence timeline. Hand on the timeline and related findings.

  - id: contain
    agent: responder
    name: "Contain"
    tools: [get_case, update_case]
    approval_required: true
    instructions: |
      If confirmed malicious: block the sender domain, quarantine matching emails,
      and plan remediation with confidence scores.

## Integrations - 

Vigil uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to connect agents to your existing tools. These MCP servers give every agent real-time access to your SIEM, EDR, threat intel, sandbox, ticketing, and communication platforms — all through a unified interface.

| Category | Integrations | Tools |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **SIEM** | Splunk | Natural language → SPL, search by IP/host/user, index listing |
| **EDR / XDR** | CrowdStrike | Alert lookup, host isolation/unisolation, host status |
| **Threat Intel** | VirusTotal, Shodan, AlienVault OTX, MISP | Hash/IP/domain/URL reputation, host recon, pulse matching, IOC search |
| **Sandbox** | Hybrid Analysis, Joe Sandbox, ANY.RUN | File submission, report retrieval, IOC extraction |
| **Timeline** | Timesketch | Forensic timeline analysis, evidence export |
| **Detection Engineering** | Security-Detections-MCP | 7,200+ rules (Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, KQL), 71 tools, coverage analysis, gap identification |
| **Ticketing** | Jira | Issue creation, updates, search |
| **Communication** | Slack | Alerts, channel creation, file uploads |
| **Data Pipeline** | Cribl Stream | Log normalization, noise filtering, multi-destination routing |
| **Core** | DeepTempo Findings, Approval, ATT&CK Layer, Tempo Flow | Built-in SOC operations |

**Coming soon:** AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel, GCP Security, Okta, Microsoft Defender, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, PagerDuty.

MCP servers live in each vendor's slice as `core/integrations/<vendor>/tool.py` and are configured via the Settings UI or `mcp_config.json`. Add a new integration by adding a slice with an MCP server in it — see [vendor slices](https://vigilsoc.org/docs/vendor-slices/) — or use the built-in Custom Integration Builder to generate one from API docs.  If you build an integration that you find useful, chances are someone else will as well.  Please contribute!

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil.git
cd vigil
./start.sh
```

> **Note:** Docker must be running before you start. The startup script handles everything else: creates the Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, starts PostgreSQL, initializes the database with a default admin user, installs frontend packages, and launches both backend and frontend servers.

Auth bypass is enabled by default (`DEV_MODE=true`) for quick development. Full auth is WIP and while it will turn on it is untested. To activate auth set `DEV_MODE=false`.

> **Stable build vs. development build:** The Quick Start above clones `main` —
> the active development branch (latest, *unreleased* code). For a stable,
> tested build, use a released version instead: pull a published image
> (`docker pull ghcr.io/vigil-soc/vigil-backend:<version>`) or check out a
> release tag before running (`git checkout v<version>`). Find the newest
> version on the [releases page](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/releases/latest).

### Prerequisites

- **No Python needed** — `./start.sh` provisions the pinned interpreter
  (`.python-version`, currently 3.12) with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
  independent of any system, conda, or pyenv Python you already have
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend)
- **Docker Desktop** (must be running — used for PostgreSQL)
- **Git** (with submodule support)
- An LLM provider key. Vigil supports Anthropic Claude (default), OpenAI, and Ollama (local) — configure providers in Settings → AI Config. See the [Bifrost gateway](https://vigilsoc.org/docs/bifrost/) notes for the multi-provider setup. *(optional for initial testing)*

### Default Login Credentials

| | |
|---|---|
| **Username** | `admin` |
| **Password** | `admin123` |

> Change these in production!

### Manual Install

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup steps</summary>

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil.git
cd vigil

# If you already cloned without --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Environment (DEV_MODE enabled by default)
cp env.example .env
# LLM provider keys (Anthropic / OpenAI / Ollama) are configured in the
# web UI at Settings → AI / LLM Providers — not in .env.

# Backend setup. uv fetches the interpreter named in .python-version, so this
# does not use (or disturb) any Python already on your PATH. Installing uv:
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
uv python install
uv venv --python "$(cat .python-version)" --python-preference only-managed venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.lock

# Frontend setup
cd clients/web
npm install
cd ..
```

</details>

### Install on Kubernetes

A production-style Helm chart lives at [`infra/helm/vigil/`](infra/helm/vigil/):

```bash
helm install vigil ./infra/helm/vigil \
  --namespace vigil --create-namespace \
  --set secrets.anthropicApiKey="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  --set secrets.postgresPassword="$(openssl rand -hex 24)" \
  --set secrets.jwtSecretKey="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))')"
```

See the [Helm values guide](https://vigilsoc.org/docs/helm/) for the full
values reference, external Postgres/Redis setup, ingress configuration, and
troubleshooting.

### Run

**Option A: All-in-one (recommended)**

```bash
# Interactive mode (keeps terminal attached, Ctrl+C to stop)
./start.sh

# OR background mode (frees terminal)
./start.sh --daemon
```

**Option B: Manual (separate terminals)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start database (Docker must be running)
cd docker && docker-compose up -d postgres

# Terminal 2: Initialize admin user and generate demo data
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/init_default_user.py
python scripts/demo.py

# Terminal 3: Start backend
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}:${PYTHONPATH}"
uvicorn services.api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6987 --reload

# Terminal 4: Start frontend
cd clients/web && npm run dev
```

### Shutdown

```bash
./shutdown_all.sh              # Stop native processes only (Docker keeps running)
./shutdown_all.sh -d           # Stop native processes + Docker containers
./shutdown_all.sh -d --full    # Stop + remove containers and volumes
```

### Access

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:6988
- **API**: http://localhost:6987
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:6987/docs

### Run with Docker (Full Stack)

```bash
cd docker && docker-compose up -d
```

Starts PostgreSQL, Backend API, and SOC Daemon.

### Run SOC Daemon (Headless Mode)

For autonomous 24/7 monitoring without the UI:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python daemon/main.py
```

### Desktop App (Standalone)

The desktop app packages the full stack into an installable bundle — no
source tree required. It runs the backend as a Docker container loaded from
an offline image tarball, alongside a bundled Bifrost LLM gateway, so
**Docker Desktop must be installed and running**. Local LLMs (Ollama) work
out of the box: Bifrost is configured to route any pulled/built model and to
reach Ollama on the host via `host.docker.internal`.

Build a local DMG (Apple Silicon shown; the image tarball is arch-specific):

```bash
# 1. Build the backend image from source and stage it as an offline tarball
bash clients/desktop/scripts/bundle-image.sh linux/arm64

# 2. Package the app (copies the Bifrost config, bundles the tarball)
cd clients/desktop && npm run dist
# -> clients/desktop/release/Vigil-<version>-arm64.dmg
```

> **macOS Gatekeeper (unsigned build).** Locally built DMGs are ad-hoc
> signed, not notarized, so macOS quarantines the app and shows *"Vigil is
> damaged and can't be opened"* or *"can't be opened because Apple cannot
> check it"*. Clear the quarantine attribute after installing to
> `/Applications`:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Vigil.app
> ```
>
> Alternatively, open it once via **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
> Open Anyway**. Proper signing/notarization is pending.

## Example Usage

### Run a Workflow
```
You: "Run incident response on finding f-20260215-abc123"
Claude: [triage] Severity: Critical — confirmed C2 beaconing from HOST-42
        [investigate] Root cause: phishing email → macro execution → Cobalt Strike beacon
        [respond] Submitted host isolation (confidence 0.96 — auto-approved)
        [report] Incident report generated with MITRE ATT&CK layer
```

### Proactive Threat Hunt
```
You: "Hunt for C2 beaconing activity across all network findings"
Claude: [hunt] Hypothesis: periodic outbound connections to rare destinations
        [network] Found 3 hosts beaconing to 185.220.101.0/24 every 300s
        [malware] Cobalt Strike beacon — extracted 4 IOCs
        [intel] IP attributed to APT28 infrastructure (confidence 0.72)
        [report] Hunt report with 12 IOCs and 3 new detection recommendations
```

### Chat-Driven Case Building
```
You: "Add this to case-20260121-abc123 and note it's part of the kill chain"
Claude: ✓ Added finding to case
        ✓ Logged activity: Part of lateral movement kill chain
        ✓ Tagged with T1021.001 (RDP)

You: "Find similar findings and add them all to this case"
Claude: ✓ Found 3 similar findings via embedding search
        ✓ Added f-002, f-003, f-004 to case
        ✓ Updated timeline with lateral movement progression
```
