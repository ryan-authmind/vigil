-- Drop the findings embedding column + its HNSW index.
--
-- Similarity is delegated to the source that owns the vector
-- (core/findings/similarity.py); Vigil no longer stores a per-finding
-- embedding. A cross-source vector column was low-signal anyway — only LogLM
-- ever supplied a real vector; every other source wrote placeholder zeros.
--
-- A NEW migration file (not edits to 17_loglm_setup.sql) is what reaches
-- existing deployments: dbInit only runs a filename it hasn't applied before.
-- Idempotent and self-guarding: safe to re-run, safe when the findings table
-- or the column is already absent (fresh install).
