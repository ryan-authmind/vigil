# Bifrost Gateway (Required)

[Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost) is a compiled Go binary that exposes a unified LLM gateway — OpenAI-format requests on `/v1` plus provider-native passthroughs (e.g. `/anthropic`). Vigil routes **all** LLM traffic through Bifrost so caching, cost tracking, and budget enforcement live in one place.

## How Vigil uses Bifrost

As of GH #84 PR-B, there is a single routing path:

- **Anthropic traffic** (including extended-thinking calls) hits Bifrost's Anthropic-compatible passthrough at `{BIFROST_URL}/anthropic` using the regular Anthropic SDK with a swapped `base_url`. This preserves extended thinking, `cache_control` blocks, and cache-token usage counters.
- **OpenAI / Ollama / other providers** hit Bifrost's `/v1` OpenAI-format surface.

The single source of truth for Anthropic client construction is `core/llm/providers/clients.py` — every `Anthropic(...)` / `AsyncAnthropic(...)` call site in the repo goes through `create_anthropic_client` / `create_async_anthropic_client`, which point at Bifrost. The lone exception is `backend/api/llm_providers.py`, which validates user-supplied API keys against the upstream provider and therefore deliberately bypasses the gateway.

The routing decision lives in `core/llm/router/router.py`. There is no direct-SDK bypass — if Bifrost is unhealthy, LLM traffic fails loudly rather than silently taking a second path.

## Pre-flight capability probe (merge blocker)

Before shipping any change that modifies how Vigil talks to Bifrost, run:

```bash
BIFROST_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
python scripts/bifrost_capability_probe.py
```

This verifies Bifrost passes through:

- basic round-trip
- the `thinking` parameter (extended thinking)
- `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` on system blocks → cache creation
- second-call cache hits surfaced as `cache_read_input_tokens` in the usage object

**If any probe fails, do not ship.** File an upstream issue on https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost and hold the change until it's fixed. Per project policy (see memory: "Single LLM routing path"), we never reintroduce a direct-SDK bypass to work around a gateway limitation.

## Starting Bifrost

Bifrost is always-on — `docker compose up` brings it up alongside the rest of the stack:

```bash
docker compose up postgres redis bifrost backend llm-worker
```

Health check: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`.

## Configuration

`docker/bifrost/config.json` declares the providers, the models Bifrost will expose, and the cache backend. API keys are **not** written into the config file — they are injected as environment variables at container start time (`env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `env.OPENAI_API_KEY`, `env.OLLAMA_URL`). Vigil's backend reads per-provider keys from its own `secrets_manager`; what's in Bifrost's env are the fallback/default keys used when a provider row in `llm_provider_configs` doesn't override them.

### Model allow-list: runtime sync, not the config file

The `models` array under each `providers.<name>.keys[0]` in `config.json` is a **cold-boot bootstrap list only**. The backend runs `sync_all_provider_models()` ([core/llm/bifrost/admin.py](../../core/llm/bifrost/admin.py)) which:

1. Queries each upstream provider's live catalog (Anthropic `/v1/models`, OpenAI `/v1/models`, Ollama `/api/tags`) via [core/llm/providers/discovery.py](../../core/llm/providers/discovery.py).
2. Writes the per-row list into the backend's dropdown cache (`_MODEL_LIST_CACHE` in [core/llm/providers/registry.py](../../core/llm/providers/registry.py)).
3. Unions the model IDs across all active providers of the same type and PUTs that union to Bifrost's admin API (`PUT /api/providers/{name}` with `keys[0].models` updated).

**Single source of truth.** `sync_all_provider_models()` is the only writer to both caches — the UI dropdown and Bifrost's allow-list come from the same call over the same upstream fetch, so they cannot drift. `fetch_provider_models()` on the read path is a pure cache lookup that falls back to a lazy sync on a cold-start miss.

**When it runs:**
- At backend startup — launched as a background task ([services/api/main.py](../../services/api/main.py) startup handler).
- **Periodically** — `MODEL_CATALOG_REFRESH_INTERVAL_S` (default 300s / 5min). Set to `0` to disable the loop and only sync once at startup.
- On demand — `POST /api/llm-providers/refresh-models` (all) or `POST /api/llm-providers/{id}/refresh-models` (one).
- Whenever a provider is added, updated, or deleted via the Providers UI — CRUD handlers invalidate the cache and schedule a background resync.

The bootstrap list in `config.json` only matters for the cold-start window (seconds) before the first sync iteration completes, or for environments where the backend can't reach upstream at startup.

### Local Ollama: wildcard routing + private-network access

Self-hosted Ollama serves whatever the user has pulled or built, so a
finite discovered allow-list is wrong — a custom model (e.g.
`qwythos-custom:latest`) would 400 with "no keys found that support model".
Two settings make local Ollama route reliably:

- **Wildcard allow-list.** The ollama key uses `"models": ["*"]` in
  `config.json`, and `sync_provider_models()` forces `["*"]` for ollama
  rather than the discovered union — so routing never depends on
  `/api/tags` enumerating a custom model.
- **`network_config.allow_private_network: true`.** Bifrost blocks RFC1918
  targets (10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x) by default. In the container path
  `OLLAMA_URL` resolves to `host.docker.internal` → the Docker Desktop
  gateway (`192.168.65.254`, RFC1918), so the flag is required or every
  call fails with "connection to private IP … is not allowed". It belongs
  in the provider's `network_config`, **not** at the key level — Bifrost's
  schema silently drops the key-level form. Loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`)
  is always allowed regardless.

Bifrost seeds `/app/data/config.db` (SQLite) from `config.json` only on
first boot; the store lives in the container's writable layer, so a
`docker compose restart` keeps the stale copy. After editing `config.json`,
re-seed with `docker compose up -d --force-recreate bifrost`.

### Legacy / non-listed models (extras)

Some upstream providers drop older model IDs from their `/v1/models` listing even when those IDs are still callable (Anthropic did this with the Claude 3.x family). To surface those in the UI and let Bifrost route traffic for them, the backend unions a configurable "extras" set into both the dropdown and Bifrost's allow-list. Extras are flagged `deprecated=True` in the API response so the UI can badge them.

The defaults live in [core/llm/providers/registry.py](../../core/llm/providers/registry.py) (`_DEFAULT_EXTRA_MODELS`) and currently cover Claude 3.5 Haiku, 3.5 Sonnet v2, and 3 Haiku. Override per deployment via env:

- `ANTHROPIC_EXTRA_MODELS="id1,id2,..."` — replaces the default list.
- `ANTHROPIC_EXTRA_MODELS=""` — disables extras for Anthropic entirely.
- `OPENAI_EXTRA_MODELS="..."` — same mechanism for OpenAI if you need it.

### Logging — authoritative cost source (#185)

Bifrost's logging plugin is the source of truth for per-call cost. The
config at `docker/bifrost/config.json` enables it explicitly with a
local SQLite store (`./logs.db` inside the Bifrost container). Vigil's
`/api/analytics/cost` time-series proxies Bifrost's
`/api/logs/histogram/cost` endpoint; on a provider repricing, an admin
hits `POST /api/analytics/recalculate-cost` (admin-only) which calls
Bifrost's `POST /api/logs/recalculate-cost` to re-cost historical rows
without a redeploy.

**Per-call correlation:** Vigil attaches a custom header
`x-bf-lh-vigil-interaction-id: <uuid>` to every upstream call (the
`x-bf-lh-*` prefix is Bifrost's logging-headers convention). The UUID
lands in Bifrost's `LogEntry.metadata` field for manual audit. We do
**not** wire automated per-call cost reconcile from Bifrost back into
`LLMInteractionLog.cost_usd` because Bifrost's `GET /api/logs` query
parameters don't currently support filtering by custom metadata —
reconciling would require pulling a time-window of logs and matching
locally on `(model, timestamp, token_counts)`, which is brittle.
Local `compute_call_cost()` remains the synchronous source for
`LLMInteractionLog.cost_usd`; Bifrost is the authority for aggregate
analytics. When Bifrost adds a metadata filter, swap to Bifrost as the
authority for the `cost_usd` column too.

**Production: switch to Postgres.** SQLite is fine for dev (the default
config above); for production set:

```json
{
  "logs_store": {
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "postgres",
    "config": {
      "host": "postgres",
      "port": "5432",
      "user": "bifrost",
      "password": "<secret>",
      "db_name": "bifrost_logs"
    }
  }
}
```

Reuse the existing `postgres` service in `docker-compose.yml` with a
separate database (UTF8 required by Bifrost). Inject the password via
your secrets manager — same pattern as the provider API keys above.

### Caching — two layers

Vigil benefits from two independent caching layers. They're **complementary**, not redundant:

| Layer | What it caches | Hit rate in practice | Savings | Run by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic native prompt caching (GH #84 PR-C) | Request prefix (system prompt + tool schemas) | Most calls within a session | ~90% on cached input tokens | Anthropic |
| Bifrost semantic cache (optional) | Full responses, keyed on embedding similarity | Only semantically similar retries | 100% on hit | Bifrost + Redis vector store |

**Anthropic prefix caching** is turned on by default (`ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED=true`, kill-switch in Settings → AI Config → AI Operations). Markers are added in `core/chat/context_manager.py:apply_prompt_cache_controls` (explicit breakpoints on system + last tool, plus top-level automatic `cache_control` for multi-turn history) and applied from both `ClaudeService` (chat + stream) and the LLM router Anthropic path — preserved by Bifrost's `/anthropic` passthrough and verified by `scripts/bifrost_capability_probe.py`.

**Bifrost's semantic cache** is opt-in and configured through the Bifrost UI at http://localhost:8080 (not via `docker/bifrost/config.json` — v1.4.23 rejects a top-level `cache` block). Enabling it requires:

1. A vector store (Redis recommended — reuse the existing Redis, a separate DB number)
2. An embedding provider (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or a local Ollama model)
3. Enabling the `semantic_cache` plugin in the UI

Run `python scripts/bifrost_cache_status.py` to check whether it's live. Vigil's unified routing does **not** depend on this layer — it's optional cost gravy on top of Anthropic's native prefix caching.

## Production deployment: keep API keys out of `.env`

Local `docker compose up` injects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`
into Bifrost via the `environment:` block, which resolves from
`.env` in the compose project directory. **That's fine for development;
it's not fine for production** — the `.env` file lives on the host, is
read by every process in the compose network, and doesn't rotate.

For production deployments, inject Bifrost's provider keys from a real
secrets manager at container start. A few patterns:

### HashiCorp Vault (agent-injector or init container)

```yaml
services:
  bifrost:
    image: maximhq/bifrost:latest
    # Vault agent writes rendered env file to a tmpfs shared volume;
    # the container sources it before the main process starts.
    command: ["sh", "-c", ". /vault/secrets/bifrost.env && exec /app/main"]
    volumes:
      - vault-secrets:/vault/secrets:ro
```

### AWS Secrets Manager (ECS task definition)

Use ECS `secrets` (not `environment`) so the agent resolves the ARN at
task launch and injects the value as an env var that never hits the
task-definition JSON:

```json
"containerDefinitions": [
  {
    "name": "bifrost",
    "secrets": [
      {"name": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:...:vigil/anthropic-api-key"},
      {"name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",    "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:...:vigil/openai-api-key"}
    ]
  }
]
```

### Kubernetes (Secret → envFrom)

```yaml
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: vigil-llm-provider-keys
```

With the `Secret` populated via Sealed Secrets, External Secrets
Operator, or whatever mechanism you already use for other app secrets —
Bifrost doesn't care, it just wants the env var present at startup.

### What stays in `.env`

Non-secret Bifrost config (URL, log level, etc.) is fine to keep in
plaintext. The distinction is: if leaking the value to a host-mounted
`.env` file is acceptable, leave it in env; otherwise, route it
through your secrets manager of choice.
