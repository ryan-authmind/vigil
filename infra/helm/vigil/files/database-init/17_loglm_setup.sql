-- LogLM feature setup: the loglm.view role grant.
--
-- This file once also provisioned a pgvector embedding column/index on
-- findings. Vigil no longer stores per-finding embeddings — similarity is
-- delegated to the owning source (core/findings/similarity.py) — so that half
-- was removed and the column/index are dropped by 23_drop_finding_embedding.sql.
--
-- Kept as a NEW migration file rather than edits to 01/06 on purpose: the
-- dbInit path only runs a file whose name it hasn't applied before, so edits to
-- already-shipped files never reach existing deployments — a new filename does.
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.

-- Grant the LogLM page-extension view permission to analyst-and-above roles.
-- Runs on both fresh and existing deployments (see the file header); the WHERE
-- guard makes it idempotent. The extension manifest declares this permission;
-- without it the LogLM tab is hidden outside DEV_MODE. `roles` always exists
-- here — 06_auth_tables.sql runs before this file on every path.
