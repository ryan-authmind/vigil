"""Authenticated passthrough to Bifrost's config API.

Bifrost's own config store is the source of truth for providers, keys, model
allow-lists, pricing and governance. This router is the console's only door to
it: Bifrost itself runs with admin auth disabled on a private network, so the
gate has to live here.

Two things it does beyond forwarding, both because Bifrost's key API cannot be
driven honestly without them (see ``core.llm.bifrost.admin`` for how these were
learned):

* **Secrets stay ours.** A key's plaintext is mirrored into the secrets store
  under ``llm_key_<key_id>`` on write and dropped on delete, so credential
  rotation and backup keep working against ``~/.vigil/secrets.enc`` rather than
  a container volume.
* **Masked values are never round-tripped.** Reads come back masked
  (``sk-a****key``) and Bifrost accepts a write that echoes the mask, storing
  the mask as the credential — every call then 401s with nothing to say why. A
  write that carries no new secret has the stored one substituted in.

    Two providers break the plain ``value`` shape:

    * **Vertex** authenticates one of two ways. A *service account* is scoped
      by ``project_id``/``region`` under ``vertex_key_config`` and carries its
      JSON in ``vertex_key_config.auth_credentials``; an *API key* carries a
      bare ``value`` like any other provider and sends no ``vertex_key_config``
      at all. The presence of that block is therefore what marks the mode.
      Either credential is mirrored to ``value`` so a single ``llm_key_<id>``
      ref backs the key, and an edit that leaves the credential blank
      substitutes the stored copy back in.
