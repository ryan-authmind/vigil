"""Schema drift on ORM-only tables — the upgrade path, not the fresh-build path.

CI only ever builds from an empty database, which is exactly why #562 was
invisible: `create_all` produces a complete schema from scratch, so a column
added to a model looks fine in CI and is missing on every existing deployment.

These tests provision a database, move the *model* forward relative to it, and
assert on what an upgrade actually does. Three current behaviours are pinned as
characterisation tests — `create_all` will not alter an existing table, the
detector notices, the ORM then raises — so that a regression in any of them is
visible. The rest cover the startup check added for #562.

The fixtures CREATE and DROP a scratch database on whatever the POSTGRES_*
variables point at, so they refuse to run against a non-local host.
