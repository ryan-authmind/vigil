"""Port inventory: nothing Compose starts by default may publish on a
non-loopback interface unless that exact port has a declared off-host consumer.

Locks in the contract from issue #587. ``infra/docker/docker-compose.yml``
published Postgres, Redis and Bifrost with bare ``"5432:5432"``-style mappings,
and Docker reads a two-part mapping as ``0.0.0.0:<host>:<container>`` — so all
three were reachable from any host on the operator's network. Postgres holds
``findings``, ``cases`` and ``llm_provider_configs`` behind a password whose
default is committed to this repo; Redis runs with no ``requirepass`` at all;
Bifrost serves an unauthenticated config API that can rewrite provider
credentials.

None of them has a consumer outside the host: the backend, daemon and workers
reach them by service name over the ``deeptempo-network`` bridge, and a
host-run backend (``start.sh``) reaches them over loopback.

This is a gate rather than a one-time fix. The original exposure survived
review precisely because a bare ``"5432:5432"`` looks deliberate, so the next
service added would repeat it silently.

The allowlist is keyed by ``(service, host port)`` rather than by service name.
Exempting a whole service would mean a debug database port added to ``backend``
later rides in unnoticed — the allowlist is meant to say "this *port* is
published on purpose", not "stop checking this service".

Scope: only services that start on a plain ``docker compose up``. Anything
behind a ``profiles:`` key (``pgadmin`` on ``dev``, the ``observability``
stack, ``splunk``, ``kafka``) is opt-in developer tooling, and several of those
still publish on all interfaces. ``pgadmin`` was the sharpest of them and is
fixed (#707, gated by ``test_pgadmin_exposure.py``); widening this file to the
rest means allowlisting the observability and Splunk/Kafka ports first, which is
its own change. One further gap worth knowing about:
``clients/desktop/standalone/docker-compose.yml`` ships to end users and is not
gated here (it is clean today). A service using ``network_mode: host`` publishes
everything while declaring no ``ports:`` — that one is caught explicitly below.
