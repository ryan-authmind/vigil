"""Guards for the router auto-discovery introduced in issue #478.

The refactor replaced 42 hand-written ``include_router`` calls with a
filesystem scan over ``core/**/*_router.py`` plus the parked modules under
``services/api/routers/``. These tests lock in the invariants
that made that safe, so the assumptions can't rot silently:

* every router module declares ``ROUTER_META`` (no convention fallback,
  because filename-inferred prefixes are wrong for 21 of 42 modules);
* mount order stays irrelevant — no route in one router can shadow a route
  in another;
* feature-gated inbound webhook receivers stay unmounted by default.
