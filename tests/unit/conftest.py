"""Database isolation for DB-backed unit tests (#747).

A unit test that writes to the database used to write to whatever the
environment pointed at, which for a developer is the database their own console
reads. ``TestApprovalQueue`` left three pending containment proposals behind per
run and 93 had piled up in the approvals queue before anyone connected the two.

Per-test cleanup would fix the tests that exist; provisioning a throwaway
database fixes the ones nobody has audited yet. Any unit test marked
``external_service`` is handed a fresh ``vigil_test_<pid>_<rand>`` built from
the ORM models, and the whole database is dropped afterwards, so a test that
forgets to tidy up cannot reach anyone's data.

Deliberately not a skip when the server is unreachable: the DB-backed CI job
exists to run these, and a fixture that skipped its way to green would retire
that gate silently. A missing Postgres is an error here.
