"""Regression tests: integration calls must not stall the event loop.

The integration clients are synchronous by design (#461: plain `def` +
threadpool, `asyncio.to_thread` as the exception). The bug these guard
against is an `async def` calling one directly, which freezes every other
task on that loop for the duration of a remote call — and
`SplunkService.search` polls its job with `time.sleep` for up to ~60s.

Each test runs the async path alongside a 10ms ticker. If the blocking call
is offloaded the ticker keeps advancing; if it is awaited on the loop the
ticker is starved and the assertion fails.
