"""DB-backed unit tests must not write to the database a human is using.

`TestApprovalQueue` used to leave three pending containment proposals in
whatever `DATABASE_URL` pointed at, once per run: 93 rows had accumulated in a
development database by the time anyone noticed, indistinguishable in the
operator's approval queue from a real proposal (#747).

The guarantee these tests assert is structural rather than per-test hygiene: a
unit test that touches the database is handed a throwaway one, so a test that
forgets to clean up cannot reach the developer's data.
